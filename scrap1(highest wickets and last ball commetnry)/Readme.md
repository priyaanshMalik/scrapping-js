# web scrapping
## the program uses the module 'request' to request data from the webpage and then makes use of the cheerio module for data extraction from the requested webpage
this web scrapping project includes:
1. scrapping the bowlers of a particular match from a webpage of www.espncricinfo.com, identifying the highest wicket taker and  scrapping the last ball commentory: file
2. scrapping the ages of various bowlers that played in a match from multiple webpages: file: "scrap2.js"


This involved usage of the request and cheerio modules multiple times for each url retrieved for all separate bowlers.

**NOTE**- either of the two points can be displayed in any order as these are callback functions
